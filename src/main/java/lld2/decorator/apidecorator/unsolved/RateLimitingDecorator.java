/**
 * TODO Task 4a - Extend the {@link BaseApiDecorator} interface to implement rate limiting functionality. Use
 * {@link apidecorator.utils.ApiUtils#rateLimitExceeded(String)} to check if the rate limit has been exceeded.
 * If it has, throw a {@link apidecorator.utils.RateLimitExceededException}, else call the next layer in the chain to execute the request.
 * <br />
 * Remember
 * 1. When you inherit from the {@link BaseApiDecorator}, you will have to implement the executeRequest method.
 * 2. You will also need to call the next layer in the chain to execute the request.
 * 3. Each decorator would also need a constructor that takes the next layer of type {@link apidecorator.api.Api}.
